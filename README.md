# LaTeX Template Letter

A very simple LaTeX document designed for correspondence and cover letters with minimal formatting in a plain and professional memo-style.

Please start by replacing this README file with a description of your project and specify the filename of your LaTeX document in the Makefile. By default, the Makefile will run `pdflatex` to render the document and then it will delete any intermediate auxiliary or log files.
